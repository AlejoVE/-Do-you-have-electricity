              This project was built to be used by Venezuelans in times of
              crisis. In the year 2019 Venezuela suffered a series of blackouts
              nationwide, the first lasted from 5 to 7 continuous days (in some
              states), the water supply was also affected because the dams did
              not have energy to pump the water. Telecommunications, hospitals,
              commerce, etc. were also affected.

              The purpose of this app is for users to easily see the list of
              reports of places where there is electricity and where there is
              not, and so they can appreciate if the power outage they are
              experiencing is temporary or a national problem, they can make
              their own report too.
            </p>

              Receiving information on time can be extremely useful, it can help
              people to be better prepared to endure long days without
              electricity, collecting water before dams stop working, for
              example
